It contains 4 file folds as follows: 

1 pars 

(A) The three parameter files for estimation 
(1) DATA1_EST_Exp_65.par was used for kriging estimation with the exponential model;
(2) DATA1_EST_Gau_45.par was used for kriging estimation with the Spherical model; 
(3) DATA1_EST_Sph_55.par was used for kriging estimation with the Gaussian model;  

(B) The three parameter files for simulation  
(1) DATA1_SIM_Exp_65.par	was used for SGS with the Spherical model;  
(2) DATA1_SIM_Gau_45.par	was used for SGS with the Spherical model;
(3) DATA1_SIM_Sph_55.par	was used for SGS with the exponential model;

Both of them can be applied by using the "load" button of the corresponding window.
