Data 1 and Data 2 stated in the manuscript are saved in CSV format.

The first row in each file lists the names of the variables. The corresponding property values are shown in the remaining rows, where -999 means that the associated data point is not used. 

Note that Data 2 is generated from the second layer (layer 2) of the Stanford VI-E dataset (Lee and Mukerji, 2012).
